    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lynn2910/Carnet-Prise.git
    cd Carnet-Prise
    ```

3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes. Choose a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/display-bug` or `feature/add-photo-sharing`).

    ```

4.  **Install the project's dependencies**:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add feature X"
    ```
    *(Tip: Using prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:` helps keep the commit history clean.)*

10. **Wait for a review**: Your PR will be reviewed, and feedback may be provided. Once approved, it will be merged into the main project.

## Style Guide

To maintain code consistency, please:
- Use the built-in Dart code formatter. You can run it with `dart format .`.
- Follow the recommendations from the static analyzer. Check for issues with `flutter analyze`.
- Adhere to the naming conventions and style of the existing codebase.

Thank you again for your contribution!
